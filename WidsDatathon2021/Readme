This is a project on huge dataset from one of the hackathons in kaggle - WiDS Datathon 2021. This dataset has 130000+ rows and 181 columns. Lot of Data preprocessing and feature enginnering is done. Several classification models were run that include Logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning, PCA dimensionality reduction technique, Random Forest classifier with hyper parameter tuning, XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
